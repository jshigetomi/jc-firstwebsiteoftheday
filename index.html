        Sergei Vasilyevich Rachmaninoff[a][b] (1 April [O.S. 20 March] 1873 â€“ 28
        March 1943) was a Russian composer, virtuoso pianist, and conductor.

      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff">
        "Rachmaninoff is widely considered one of the finest pianists of his day
        and, as a composer, one of the last great representatives of Romanticism
        in Russian classical music. Early influences of Tchaikovsky,
        Rimsky-Korsakov, and other Russian composers gave way to a thoroughly
        personal idiom notable for its song-like melodicism, expressiveness and
        rich orchestral colours."
